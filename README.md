## About

#### The inspiration
This idea arose because we as software developers often tend to procrastinate with web applications that are just distractions and also distract us with our co-workers causing less productivity in our working hours
We wanted to create this chrome extension so that we and our co-workers can compete for better productivity at work though a game.
